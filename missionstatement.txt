Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Tesla was founded by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn't need to compromise to drive electric â€“ we hope our electric cars will cut down on harmful emissions, while still providing our customers with a quicker, and more cost effective car.
